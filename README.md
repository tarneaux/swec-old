# Swec - Simple Web Endpoint Checker

(Or "Services Workin', Eventually Checkin")

This is very much a work in progress. The goal is to have a program which exposes an API where you can get recent statuses of HTTP endpoints. We are already pretty close, but I still need to add a decent configuration mechanism (config file/stdin reading/env vars/whatever).
